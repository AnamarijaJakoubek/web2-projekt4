    <h1>Tekst</h1>
    <p>Nginx, developed by Igor Sysoev, is a powerful web server that can perform other important tasks such as load balancing, serving as a mail proxy or reverse proxy, and HTTP caching. Although it’s not as popular as Apache, Nginx is a more efficient web server in terms of resource allocation and efficiency.


        There are actually two different version of Nginx. Nginx is an open-source software, whereas Nginx Plus is the commercial version that comes with user support. Both software fully support HTTP/2.
        
        To enable HTTP/2 on Nginx, there are a few things to know:
        
        It’s important to enable HTTPS on your server because almost all browsers allow HTTP/2 only over HTTPS.
        TLS protocol version 1.2 and above with modern cipher suites is required.
        Nginx Open Source version 1.9.5 or higher has built-in support for HTTP/2. Nginx Plus R7 and all higher versions fully support HTTP/2.Nginx, developed by Igor Sysoev, is a powerful web server that can perform other important tasks such as load balancing, serving as a mail proxy or reverse proxy, and HTTP caching.
